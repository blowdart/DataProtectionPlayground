# Data Protection Playground
This is a collection of sample projects for ASP.NET v5's data protection stack. 
It's used as a demonstration during some of my presentations.
It probably won't make much sense without watching the presentation.

Slides, and sometimes video of my presentations can be found at https://idunno.org
